# Dot Ignorer

**Dot Ignorer** is here to help you manage `.gitignore` files directly within Visual Studio Code.

Generate `.gitignore` files effortlessly using a wide range of curated templates and customize them as needed.

## Features

- **Generate `.gitignore`:** Quickly create `.gitignore` files using a comprehensive list of templates for various languages, frameworks, and environments (e.g., Node, Python, React, Vite, Java, Ruby, Go, and many more).
- **Curated Templates:** Access templates sourced from the official GitHub gitignore repository and other project-specific sources.
- **Simple & Fast:** Lightweight extension with zero configuration required.

2. Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).
3. Run the command: `Dot Ignorer: Create git ignore`.
